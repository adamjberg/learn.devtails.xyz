## Introduction

This is the first project in a series of projects to teach web development through building applications.  Deploying a website is often the last step presented (if even mentioned) in web development tutorials.  This series will instead focus on deployable projects running on your own domain. 

Unfortunately deploying code can be a bit of a process. In order to not overwhelm beginners, this post intentionally doesn't go into deep detail about what things are and how they work.  Future projects will go into much greater detail.

One of the neat advantages to deploying your code is that automated checks can confirm your project works as expected.  At the end of this post is a "Submit Project" section.  This one should be fairly easy to check on your own, but future projects may have more complicated behaviour that will be assessed.
